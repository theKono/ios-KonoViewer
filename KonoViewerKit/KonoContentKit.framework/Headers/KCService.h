/**
 @file KCService.h
 
 @brief
 In the Kono Content data layer famework( We name as KonoContentKit), we use this file(KCService) as an API public interface. We expect all user integrate our framework with their application could get their content simply through the function defined here.

 From our content server database schema, using top-down approach.
 
 We can own several libraries, for each library, we can set [1-many] categories. 
 For each category, we can list [1-many] titles. 
 Each title would have [1-many] issues(presenting by KCBook object in this framework). 
 Each issue contains [1-many] articles(presenting by KCBookArticle object in this framework).
 And Each article would have [1-many] pages(presenting by KCBookPage in this framework)
 
 Only the function which can get content resource need additional token and decrypt operation.
 We also support basic maintaining dowloaded bundle function in this framework.
